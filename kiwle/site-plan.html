        Since there is room for love in that small workshop, where art began between earthen walls with a roof full of holes through which the sun's rays entered, hard hands, a firm back and great ingenuity were the participants in creating textiles. Craftsmanship is a legacy for our culture.

          On this website you can see the products, we have on stock and see the new updates. Creating this website, itâ€™s an easier way for my clients to see the products I have and know what we do as indigenous community. 
          This website will cover mostly handmade clothing from my hometown, Otavalo. You can find here information about the materials used for the clothing and the process of the product.
          You can browser the products and see the different materials, colors, and patterns we have.  Also, you can choose the elements and see the variety we have.

      <h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
      <p>
        Since 1980, the precision of each yarn, cut, and fold has been our example for each product during decades. Our commitment to Kiwle manufacturing is unwavering for all our products made by handmade process in Ecuador and distributing to different countries with no compromised craftsmanship. 

        Manufacturing.

    
       We are committed to being transparent about how and where we make our Kiwle products. We design our products caring the texture and the bright colors that represents our indigenous community. These products are inspired in the beauty of our mountains, rivers, animals that repents our indigenous community to the world. 
       The main purpose is that others can get to know what the indigenous community can create. This is a traditional way to work of the native people in Otavalo and is a heritage to know how to keep doing handmade clothing. 
       Our people carefully select the material that will be used on the process to create the product because the texture is always important for us. We design products for a lifetime and not for a season using the highest quality of materials. Since this is handmade clothing, we care about nature and use the less microplastic and use material friendly with the nature. We want to give back to our nature.
