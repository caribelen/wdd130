        <div class="msg2">
            <p>The main purpose is that others can get to know what the indigenous community can create. This is a traditional way to work of the native people in Otavalo and is a heritage to know how to keep doing handmade clothing. Our people carefully select the material that will be used on the process to create the product because the texture is always important for us. We design products for a lifetime and not for a season using the highest quality of materials. Since this is handmade clothing, we care about nature and use the less microplastic and use material friendly with the nature. We want to give back to our nature.</p>
